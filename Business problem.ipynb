Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a Taco restaurant in Toronto.\nSince there are lots of restaurants in Toronto we will try to get locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity. \nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.</p>\n"
